# Monk-And-Welcome-Problem
Having a good previous year, Monk is back to teach algorithms and data structures. This year he welcomes the learners with a problem which he calls "Welcome Problem". The problem gives you two arrays A and B (each array of size N) and asks to print new array C such that:
 ; 
Now, Monk will proceed further when you solve this one. So, go on and solve it :)

Input:
First line consists of an integer N, denoting the size of A and B.
Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array A.
Next line consists of N space separated integers denoting the array B.
